Telekinesis Demo in Unity

This is a quick demo of a telekinetic power system in Unity. A couple of interesting things:
- Sound effects on the blocks are scaled by force of impacts
- The powers are interface-based, so it could easily be changed to operate differently on different objects
- The effects are recipient-side, so they are also easy to change for different desires outcomes
